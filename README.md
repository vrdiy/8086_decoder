# 8086 Decoder
This is a homework project from *Performance Aware Programming* course by Casey Muratori.


# Run tests:
Currently this code can create binary matching disassemblies for listings 0037->0042. 
1. Run `python test_decode_8086.py` once to generate test directories
2. Populate the tests/listings folder with listings from [Casey's repo](https://github.com/cmuratori/computer_enhance/tree/main/perfaware/part1)
3. Run the following command in the project directory: 
```
python -m unittest discover
```
